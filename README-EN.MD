# notranslate-Prevent translating snippets and formulas
When using chrome translation, math equations and code segments are translated, causing unnecessary trouble?
This script aims to prevent unnecessary translation of code segment and math equations.

## How To Use
To use this script, use the keyboard `ctrl + Q` when the page is ready (such as after the page is loaded and before translation), and then confirm.
Please note that you need to do this before clicking "Translate".

## Possible Problems
Because the script is not yet complete, some types of content may not be detected. You can modify the `behaviorList` of the script yourself.
If you like, please contact me to update the script. Via [GitHub](https://github.com/windingwind/notranslate/issues) or [mail](wyzlshx@foxmail.com).
